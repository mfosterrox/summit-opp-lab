= Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes

[[outline]]

== Module outline

This lab's goal is to showcase the features of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) while observing the Java application that you deployed earlier in the Quay module. 

We will start with the basics of navigation and progress into vulnerability management, policy management and enforcement and finish with CI/CD integration. 

=== RHACS basics

RHACS provides the tools and capabilities to address the security needs of a cloud-native development approach on Kubernetes. These security features represent any developer or administrator’s primary work across various environments, including multiple datacenters, private clouds, or public clouds that run Kubernetes clusters.

=== RHACS features

Using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes, you can gain comprehensive Kubernetes security that includes the following use cases:

- *Visibility:* See your entire landscape of images, registries, containers, deployments, and runtime behavior.
- *Vulnerability* Management: Identify and remediate vulnerabilities in container images and Kubernetes across the entire software development life cycle.
- *Compliance:* Audit your systems against CIS Benchmarks, NIST, PCI, and HIPAA, with interactive dashboards and one-click audit reports.
- *Network Segmentation:* Visualize existing connections and enforce tighter segmentation using Kubernetes-native controls to reduce your blast radius.
- *Risk Profiling:* See all your deployments ranked by risk level, using context from Kubernetes' declarative data, to prioritize remediation.
- *Configuration Management:* Apply best practices for Docker and Kubernetes to harden your environment for a more secure and stable application.
- *Threat Detection:* Use rules, automated allow lists, and baselining to accurately identify suspicious activity in your running applications.
- *Incident Response:* Take action, from failing builds and blocking deployments to killing pods and thwarting attacks, using Kubernetes for enforcement.

== Introduction to the RHACS console

The first section of this lab will focus on navigation and vulnerability management. This work will take place in the UI and require you to use both the dashboard and the lab environment.

=== Navigating the RHACS console

In this section, you familiarize yourself with the RHACS portal, including its tabs, search capabilities and dashboard functionality.

The RHACS dashboard has four main sections:

. Navigation bar
. Navigation drawer
. Dashboard

image::acs-numbered-dashboard.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Numbered Dashboard]

=== Navigation bar

The top bar contains the following functionality: 

- Global search 
- Command-line tools 
- Cluster health 
- Documentation 
- API reference 
- Enable dark/light Mode 
- Logged-in user account

image::acs-top-bar.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Navigation Bar]

=== Global Search

The ability to instantly find resources is essential to safeguard your cluster. Utilize the RHACS search feature to find relevant resources faster.

For example, you can use it to find deployments exposed to a newly published CVE or all deployments with external network exposure.

A search query consists of two parts:

- An attribute that identifies the resource type you want to search for.
- A search term that finds the matching resource.

For example, to find all violations in the *ctf-web-to-system* deployment, the search query is *Deployment:ctf-web-to-system*.

In this search query, Deployment is the attribute, and ctf-web-to-system is the search term.

NOTE: The search field in RHACS requires each attribute to be entered fully as a search term. Enter your first attribute, and hit the <tab> key to move along to the next attribute you would like to enter. Results will appear once there are matches to the entered query.

image::acs-search-ctf-00.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Search Syntax]

NOTE: RHACS maintains a library of searchable assets to help you search faster, they will appear in a drop-down list, and you can click on them to enter them as well. If a specific CVE or deployment cannot be found, please confirm the spelling of the asset name, or that it is correctly deployed in the cluster. 

=== Common search queries

Here are some common search queries you can try in the RHACS search bar if you’d like to test its functionality.

|============
|Query|Example|Purpose
|CVE:<CVE_number>|CVE:CVE-2018-11776|Finding deployments that are affected by a specific CVE
|Privileged:<true_or_false>|Privileged:true|Finding privileged running deployments
|Exposure Level:<level>|Exposure Level:External|Finding deployments that have external network exposure
|============

image::acs-search-cve.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Search Syntax]

NOTE: This is just a sample of the types of queries you can use to analyze your environment in RHACS. For additional examples of search queries, please see the RHACS documentation.

=== Local page filtering

You can use local page filtering from within all views in the RHACS portal. Local page filtering works similarly to the global search, but only relevant attributes are available. You can select the search bar to show all available attributes for a specific view.

=== Navigation menu

image::acs-nav-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Navigation Menu]

The left-hand navigation menu provides access to each of the security use cases, as well as product configuration to integrate RHACS with your existing tooling. The navigation menu has the following items:

- Dashboard: Summary view of your environment
- Network Graph: Configured and actual network flows and the creation of Network Policies to implement network segmentation
- Violations: Events that do not match the defined security policies
- Compliance: Several industry and regulatory security standards, such as PCI DSS
- Vulnerability Management: Information about known vulnerabilities affecting your environment, including deployed workloads and infrastructure, risk acceptance and reporting.
- Configuration Management: Identification of potential misconfigurations that can lead to security issues
- Risk: Risks affecting your environment, such as suspicious executions
- Platform Configuration: RHACS configuration, policy management and integration details, including;
* Clusters
* Policy Management
* Integrations
* Access Control
* System Configuration
* System Health

=== Dashboard 

The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) Dashboard provides quick access to the data you need. It contains additional navigation shortcuts and actionable widgets that are easy to filter and customize so that you can focus on the data that matters most to you. You can view information about levels of risk in your environment, compliance status, policy violations, and common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) in images.

image::acs-dashboard-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Center Dashboard]

=== Navigating the main dashboard

The main dashboard is your place to look at the vulnerabilities, risk, compliance, and policy violations across your clusters and namespaces. This section addresses all of the functionality in the main dashboard to help you navigate it more effectively in the future.
The dashboard can be broken down into three main sections:

. The status bar
. The dashboard filter
. The actionable widgets

image::acs-dashboard-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Three Dashboard Sections]

=== 1. The status bar

The status bar provides at-a-glance numerical counters for critical resources. The counters reflect what is visible with your current access scope, defined by the roles associated with your user profile. 

These counters are clickable, providing fast access to the desired list view pages as follows:

|============
|Counter|Destination
|Clusters|Platform Configuration -> Clusters
|Nodes|Configuration Management -> Applications & Infrastructure -> Nodes
|Violations|Violations Main Menu
|Deployments|Configuration Management -> Applications & Infrastructure -> Deployments
|Images|Vulnerability Management -> Dashboard -> Images
|Secrets|Configuration Management -> Applications & Infrastructure -> Secrets
|============

=== 2. The dashboard filter 

The dashboard includes a top-level filter that applies simultaneously to all widgets. You can select clusters and one or more namespaces within selected clusters. Any change to the filter is immediately reflected by all widgets, limiting the data they present to the selected scope.

NOTE: The dashboard filter does not affect the status bar and when no clusters or namespaces are selected, the view automatically switches to All.

image::acs-dashboard-03.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Dashboard Filter]

image::acs-dashboard-04.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Dashboard Drop-down]

=== 3. Actionable widgets

If you have time, adjust the dashboard filtering options and widgets to hone the filtering capabilities.

With these widgets, you can customize the information displayed on the dashboard by default in order to find the items that you consider most important to your deployments and your business' security.

[[vuln-mgmt]]

== The Vulnerability Management dashboard

Let us continue by looking at our primary use case for RHACS and that is the Vulnerability Management features and dashboard, a familiar topic for most security teams.

IMPORTANT: The locations and size of your panels may vary depending on your screen size and zoom.

NOTE: For the following section, please note that the order in which the images appear or the number of components affected may vary depending on versions and other applications running in the cluster.

. Click the *Vulnerability Management (1.0)* tab, and then select *Dashboard*

image::215-vuln-dashboard.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Vulnerability Management Dashboard]

The dashboard provides several important vulnerability breakdowns such as:

- Top risky deployments/images
- Recently detected image vulnerabilities
- Most common image vulnerabilities

More important than fixing any vulnerability is establishing a process to keep container images updated and to prevent the promotion through the pipeline for images with serious, fixable vulnerabilities. RHACS displays this through the *Top Risky Deployments by CVE and CVSS Score* and takes the container’s configuration and vulnerability details to show you the most *at risk* deployments in your cluster.

image::216-top-risky.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Riskiest Deployments]

[start=2]

. Above the panel information, there are buttons to link you to all policies, CVEs, and images, and a menu to bring you to reports by cluster, namespace, deployment, and component. The vulnerability dashboard can be filtered by clicking the *Fixable CVSS score* button.

image::217-policy-buttons.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Top Policy Buttons]

[start=3]

. Locate the *Top riskiest images* panel. 

Here you can see the CVEs associated with containers currently running in the cluster. The goal is to find the *log4shell* exploit in your cluster and block that container from being pushed in the future.

image::acs-risk-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Riskiest Images]

. In the *Top Riskiest Images* panel, click on the *VIEW ALL* button.

image::acs-risk-03.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Riskiest Images]

The images in this dashboard are listed here in order of *risk*, 

Risk is based on a multitude of security issues such as

- the severity of the vulnerabilities present
- in the components in the images
- vulnerability impact
- the image is active

image::acs-risk-04.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Riskiest Images]

Notice which images are more exposed. Not only can we see the number of CVEs affecting the images, but which of them are fixable? We can also see:

- Creation date
- Scan time
- Image OS
- Image status
- How many deployments are using the vulnerable image
- The total components in the image

. Next, find and click on the image *ctf-web-to-system:latest-v2*. You will review the images' components and violations.

image::219-visa-proc.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Visa Processor Image]





NOTE: If you cannot find the ctf-web-to-system:latest-v2 image, use the search bar to filter for the specific image you want.

If you click the search bar, you will be shown the different labels you can search by. Click Image and type visa until the correct image comes up.

You can use this method of searching in all search bars within the RHACS dashboard.

image::220-search-bar.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Search Bar]

You can move on to the next section only when the dashboard displays the image below.

image::221-image-info.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Image Info]


=== RHACS Vulnerability Scanner

RHACS' built-in vulnerability scanner breaks down images into layers and components - where components can be operating-system installed packages or dependencies installed by programming languages like Python, Javascript, or Java. The Image Summary provides the essential security details of the image overall, with links to the components. Below you can see why the image is ranked as a critically vulnerable application:

- In the *Details and metadata* → Image Summary panel, the information you see there tells you that this image has a severe security problem - the base image was imported several years ago (Debian 8 - 2015).
- At the top of the page is the warning that CVE data is stale - that this image has a base OS version whose distribution has stopped providing security information and likely stopped publishing security fixes.
- Scroll down the page. In the Image Findings section, you find the details of the image vulnerabilities. There are 535 fixable vulnerabilities in the cluster (at the time of the creation of this workshop.)

image::222-fix-vulns.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Fixable Vulnerabilities]

- Above the Image Findings section, click on the *Dockerfile* tab:

image::223-dockerfile.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Dockerfile View]

The Dockerfile tab view shows the layer-by-layer view, and, as you can see, the most recent layers are also several years old. Time is not kind to images and components - as vulnerabilities are discovered, RHACS will display newly discovered CVEs.

*Now let's put this UI to the test with a real use case!*


=== log4shell CVE Vulnerability Analysis

It is time to find the components that have the log4shell vulnerability in your cluster. Zero day and high priority vulnerabilities need to be triaged quickly. The log4shell vulnerability provides a great example of how security teams can assess a vulnerability's impact quickly and effectively.

Check out the Red Hat advisory for more details:

. Head back to the *Top Riskiest Images* Dashboard. (Vulnerability Management (1.0) → Top Riskiest Images)

image::224-riskiest-images2.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Riskiest Images]

. Search for the log4shell vulnerability using its CVE number (*CVE-2021-44228*)

image::225-log4shell-search.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, log4shell Search]

- How many images are affected by the vulnerability?
- How many deployments contain the vulnerability?
- Why do you think the risk priority is where it is?
- Should the risk priority be higher? Or lower?

NOTE: The log4shell CVE is very serious - scoring 10/10 - and is fixable.

Luckily there is only *ONE* image being affected by this vulnerability (2 deployments), so you could go directly to the source and fix all three deployments in one opportunity.

*How would your DevSecOps team address this vulnerability?*


=== Relating Image CVEs with Kubernetes Configuration Properties

All of these CVE details are well and good, but they are a bit noisy. How do we judge the genuine risk - which vulnerabilities are likely to be exploited? Which vulnerabilities do we have to fix first? RHACS can use other sources of information in OpenShift to judge the risk that a given vulnerability would be exploited and set priorities for fixes.

The first *risk factor* - is the vulnerable component in a running deployment.

. Click on the *Risk* panel to continue.

image::226-risk-panel.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Risk Panel]

Take a look at the total amount of deployments in the cluster. If you remember, the log4shell image was rated a 5 on risk priority based on CVSS score and other CVEs. But at the time this lab is written it now shows as a 12. Why, we must ask ourselves, is it scored differently in this dashboard?

image::227-log4shell-risk.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Log4Shell Risk]

. Click on the log4shell deployment and review the risk indicators.

image::228-log4shell-info.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Log4Shell Info]

. Next, click on the ctf-web-to-system deployment and review its risk indicators. What do you think made the ctf-web-to-system deployment #1 in this example?

image::229-ctf-web-to-system.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Visa Processor Info]

Factors that play into the overall score are in the risk indicators section. These include, but are not limited to:

- Policy Violations
- Image Vulnerabilities
- Service Configuration
- Service Reachability
- Components Useful for Attackers
- Number of Components in an Image
- Image Freshness
- RBAC Configuration

A primary reason for the ctf-web-to-system deployment to be ranked so high is that it is an ancient image (older than the log4shell app). A good indicator of risk is that the older an image is, the more likely it will have a significant exploitable vulnerability.

We will leave it to you to make your own risk assessments in the future. 

Now, let us move along to enforcing a log4shell policy and stopping future deployments containing the vulnerability.

[[policy-mgmt]]

== Policy Management

RHACS has many built-in policies to detect activity related to attacker goals: gain a foothold, maintain a presence, move laterally, and exfiltrate data. The continuous runtime monitoring observes all container activity and will automatically respond to events with appropriate enforcement and notification. However, that would be missing out on an opportunity - RHACS wants to go one step further, to take advantage of containers' ephemeral, immutable nature, to improve security in a measurable way from now on.

We want to use runtime incidents and vulnerabilities as a learning opportunity to improve security going forward by constraining how our containers can act. We achieve this by creating policies and implementing them early in the CI/CD process.

As we move into this next section, lets focus on identifying and enforcing a runtime policy in the cluster. For the upcoming example, we will focus on stopping the Ubuntu package manager from being run on pods in our cluster.

. On the left-hand side of the application, click the *Platform Configuration* tab and select *Policy Management*.

image::230-policy-mgmt-dashboard.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Policy Management Dashboard]

. Filter through the policies to find *Ubuntu Package Manager Execution* or use the search bar to select by *category*.

image::231-policy-search.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Policy Management Search]

. Once you have found the policy *Ubuntu Package Manager Execution*, click on it to learn more.

image::232-policy-mgmt-details.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Policy Management Details]

. If you click the actions button, you will see how easy it is to edit, clone, export or disable these policies. We also recommended cloning the policies and adding or removing specific filters as you need them.

== Introduction to Deploy-Time Policy Enforcement

In this lab, you explore how Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) can prevent the deployment of applications that violate workflow, configuration, or security best practices before they become actively running containers.

There are two approaches to enforcing deploy-time policies in RHACS:

- In clusters with **listen** and **enforce** AdmissionController options enabled, RHACS uses the admission controller to reject deployments that violate policy.
- In clusters where the enforcement option is disabled, RHACS scales pod replicas to zero for deployments that violate policy.

In this lab, the enforcement action output that is documented assumes that the AdmissionController deployment is created with the listen and enforce options enabled.

- Prevent unscanned images from deployment
- Prevent misuse of environment variables at deploy time

== Prevent Unscanned Images from Deployment

RHACS can block the deployment of container images that were not scanned for vulnerabilities either by the RHACS Scanner or other, third-party vulnerability scanners. Enforcing the use of vulnerability scanning is an important part of general security practices and in industry and regulatory standards like NIST 800-190, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA.

=== Configure Admission Controller

Using admission controller enforcement for image-based scanning requires enabling the AdmissionController deployment and configuring it to contact image scanners.

. Verify that admission controller and image scanning are set up properly by navigating to Platform Configuration → Clusters → Production and verifying that the following settings are enabled:

image::246-settings-enabled.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Verify Settings Enabled]

image::247-dynamic-config.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Dynamic Configuration]

NOTE: Before configuring this lab, be aware that enforcing this policy blocks all deployments that use images for which RHACS Central cannot retrieve results. For more information, review the RHACS help for Scanner and Image Registries.

. Navigate to Platform Configuration → Policy Management, find the Images with no scans policy through the filter, and select it to open the side panel.

image::248-image-noscan.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Images with No Scans]

. On the first page, click Edit and enable the policy. This policy rejects attempts to deploy an image that has no scanning status.
. On your student VM, use Kubernetes to deploy a deliberately nonsensical image with no scans:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-project test
oc run nonsense --image=test-nonsense:latest
----

RHACS evaluates the policy and performs the default behavior by informing on the violation by the Kubernetes admission controller, creating a logged event.

We can check this by clicking on the *Violations* menu on the left hand side.

image::248a-violation-log.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Violation Log]

In our next section we will discuss how to configure RHACS to block container actions at either deploy-time or runtime.

=== Enforce Deploy-Time Policy on Misuse of Environment Variables

In this section, you explore using RHACS to prevent the deployment of applications that mishandle sensitive data (such as account keys, certificates, or passwords).

Container-based microservices applications face challenges when providing sensitive information like passwords to running containers. For example, an e-commerce application may have an order status microservice that needs to read records from a database that requires a username and password to execute queries. It is a critical security practice to keep passwords private.

Unfortunately, several methods for distributing secrets that have come into common use fail to protect sensitive content or restrict access to secrets. One of these insecure methods is to store sensitive data in the clear in Kubernetes deployment YAML files. This section demonstrates how RHACS can bring this misuse to light and encourage a developer to use a proper secrets management method.

RHACS also has a separate feature for visibility into the Kubernetes Secrets feature, a method for distributing secrets to deployments natively in Kubernetes. For more information, see the RHACS documentation.

This section demonstrates two separate enforcement points for policies: at build time (perhaps as part of a CI/CD job) and at deployment time in a Kubernetes cluster.

. Create the following Deployment manifest on your student VM:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF >$HOME/secrets.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ubuntu
  labels:
    app: ubuntu
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ubuntu
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ubuntu
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: ubuntu
        image: ubuntu:18.04
        env:
            - name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
              value: "abcdefg"
EOF
----

. In the Platform Configuration → Policy Management page of the RHACS web console, locate the *Environment Variable Contains Secret* policy.
. Click the *Actions* drop down and verify the policy is enabled, or enable it if not. At build time, the roxctl binary can be used to **preview** the Deployment before actually attempting to create it in a Kubernetes cluster.
. Supply the file containing this YAML to roxctl on your student VM to run the Deployment check:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
roxctl -e $ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS:443 deployment check --file ./secrets.yaml --insecure-skip-tls-verify
----

. Among the policy violations, review the output and expect to see the following:

[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----
Policy check results for deployments: [ubuntu]
(TOTAL: 6, LOW: 3, MEDIUM: 2, HIGH: 1, CRITICAL: 0)

WARN:   A total of 6 policies have been violated
----

In a CI/CD pipeline service, this output is available to the developer via the job’s console output, and the job fails because of this failed roxctl check.

If a developer were to bypass the CI/CD checks, or deploy manually without any build-time controls, RHACS can still enforce policies at deployment time. RHACS does this by using policy evaluation and admission controller enforcement.

. To see this in action, deploy the secrets file:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc create -f secrets.yaml
----

[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----
Error from server (Failed currently enforced policies from StackRox): error when creating "secrets.yaml": admission webhook "policyeval.stackrox.io" denied the request:
The attempted operation violated 1 enforced policy, described below:

Policy: Environment Variable Contains Secret
- Description:
    - Alert on deployments with environment variables that contain 'SECRET'
- Rationale:
    - Using secrets in environment variables may allow inspection into your secrets
      from the host or even through the orchestrator UI.
- Remediation:
    - Migrate your secrets from environment variables to orchestrator secrets or your
      security team's secret management solution.
- Violations:
    - Environment variable 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' is present in container 'ubuntu'

In case of emergency, add the annotation {"admission.stackrox.io/break-glass": "ticket-1234"} to your deployment with an updated ticket number
----

In this lab, you explored how RHACS can prevent the deployment of applications that violate workflow, configuration, or security best practices before they become actively running containers.

You saw how to use the AdmissionController with the listen and enforce options enabled to reject deployments that violate policy.

In clusters where the enforcement option is disabled, you saw how RHACS scales pod replicas to zero for deployments that violate policy.

IMPORTANT: Once this section is complete, go back and disable enforcement of this policy (set back to inform), else it may affect other actions in the lab.


[[runtime-enforce]]

== Introduction to Runtime Policy Enforcement

RHACS observes container processes and collects this information to enable you to craft policies to prevent behavior that you don’t like. This information can also create baseline policy configurations that the user can update.

The example below demonstrates how security may want to block a package manager from downloading any packages to the container. This runtime enforcement option is the first in the process of shifting left. After runtime enforcement, you will want to stop the package manager from being used in the container altogether.

=== Prevent Execution of Package Manager Binary

Package managers like apt (Ubuntu), apk (Alpine), or yum/dnf (RedHat) are binary software components used to manage and update installed software on a Linux® host system. They are used extensively to manage running virtual machines. But using a package manager to install or remove software on a running container violates the immutable principle of container operation.

This policy demonstrates how RHACS detects and avoids a runtime violation, using Linux kernel instrumentation to detect the running process and OpenShift® to terminate the pod for enforcement. Using OpenShift to enforce runtime policy is preferable to enforcing rules directly within containers or in the container engine, as it avoids a disconnect between the state that OpenShift is maintaining and the state where the container is operating. Furthermore, because a runtime policy may detect only part of an attacker’s activity inside a container, removing the container avoids the attack.

=== Enable Enforcement of Policy

. Navigate to *Platform Configuration → Policy Management* and find the *Ubuntu Package Manager Execution* policy.
. On the *Policy Management* page, type *Policy  Ubuntu* into the filter bar at the top.
. Select the policy *Ubuntu Package Manager Execution*.
. Click the *Actions* button then click *Edit policy*.
. Select the *Policy Behavior* tab.
. Enable runtime enforcement by clicking the *inform and enforce* button.
. Configure enforcement behavior by selecting *Enforce at Runtime*.

image::249-enforce-runtime.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Enforce Runtime Policy]

. Click save.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to save the policy changes! If you do not save the policy the process will not be blocked!

=== Testing the Configured Policy

Next, we will use tmux to watch OpenShift events while running the test, so you can see how RHACS enforces the policy at runtime.

. On your student VM, ssh over to the *Bastion* host, and start tmux with two panes:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
tmux new-session \; split-window -v \; attach
----

. Next, run a watch on OpenShift events in the first shell pane:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get events -w
----

. Press *Ctrlb, o* to switch to the next pane. (Ctrlb THEN o)
. Run a temporary Ubuntu OS image using the tmp-shell application:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc run tmp-shell --labels="app=tmp-shell" --rm -i --tty --image ubuntu:18.04 -- /bin/bash
----

NOTE: After the cluster pulls the image and starts the pod, expect to see a Linux command shell as shown.

[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
root@tmp-shell:/#
----

. Run the package manager in this shell:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
apt update
----

. Examine the output and expect to see that the package manager attempts to perform an update operation:

ion ended, resume using 'oc attach tmp-shell -c tmp-shell -i -t' command when the pod is running
No resources found
----

. Examine the oc get events tmux pane (The pane on the bottom), and note that it shows that RHACS detected the package manager invocation and deleted the pod:

[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]

0s          Normal    Killing                pod/tmp-shell   Stopping container tmp-shell
----

NOTE: After about 30 seconds you can see the pod is deleted.

. In your tmux shell pane, note that your shell session has terminated and that you are returned to the student VM command line.

NOTE: You can always type exit into the terminal or reload the terminal using the button on the top right of the workshop environment.

[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]

Congrats! You have successfully stopped yourself from downloading malicious packages! However, the security investigative process continues, as you have now raised a flag that must be triaged!

[[report-resolve]]

== Report and Resolve Violations

At this point, any attacker using a shell to install software is now disconnected from the environment. A complete record of the event is available on the *Violations* page.

. Navigate to the *Violations* page.
. Filter by the policy violation *Ubuntu Package Manager Execution* OR by the most recent policy violations. You will see a policy violation that has been enforced 1 time.
. Click the most recent violation and explore the list of the violation events:

image::250-violations.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Violations Menu]

If configured, each violation record is pushed to a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) integration, and is available to be retrieved via the API. The forensic data shown in the UI is recorded, including the timestamp, process user IDs, process arguments, process ancestors, and enforcement action.

After this issue is addressed, in this case by the RHACS product using the runtime enforcement action, you can remove it from the list by marking it as *Resolved*.

. Lastly, hover over the violation in the list to see the resolution options and resolve this issue as operator error.

image::251-resolve-violation.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Resolve Violations]

For more information about integration with SIEM tools, see the RHACS help documentation on external tools.

Congratulations! You successfully stopped packages from being downloaded to the host by setting a runtime enforcement policy.

== Conclusion

In summary, we made use of the features provided by Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes to display potential security violations in your cluster in a central dashboard. We also used the default tools to examine known image vulnerabilities and network communication and segmentation in our cluster. Lastly we crafted both deploy-time and runtime policies to help prevent malicious events from occurring in our cluster. Hopefully this lab has helped demonstrate to you the immense value provided by RHACS and OpenShift Platform Plus. Please feel free to continue and explore the RHACS lab environment, or continue on to the next portion of the lab at your leisure.
