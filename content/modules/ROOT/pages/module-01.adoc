= Red Hat Quay

This module will give a brief overview of Quay and show the value of local image management, 

== Security Scanning

Red Hat Quay can also help with securing our environments by performing a security scan on any images added to our registry, and advise which ones are potentially fixable.

To get started, let's log in to Red Hat Quay

Your Red Hat Quay console is available at: {quay_console_url}[window=blank]

[cols="1,1"]
|===
*Quay Console Username:* | {quay_admin_username} |
*Quay Console Password:* | {quay_admin_password} |
*Quay Console URL"*      | {quay_console_url}    |

We can use the following procedure to check the security scan results for our UBI image we just uploaded.

. Click on the ubi repository and once inside click on the tags button on the left.

+
NOTE: You may need to click the checkbox near the image you would would like more information on, but the column for *Security Scan* should populate.
+
. By default, the security scan color codes the vulnerabilities, you can hover over the security scan for more information.

+
NOTE: The ubi image we are using in this lab shows 36 medium vulnerabilities, and 187 total when you hover over it at the time of this lab's creation.
+
. Click on the list of vulnerabilities to see a more detailed view.
+

+
. Click the packages button on the left menu to see which specific packages in the image are affected by what vulnerabilities.
+

+
Congratulations, you now know how to examine images in your registry for potential vulnerabilities before deploying into your environment.

IMPORTANT: As of the creation date of this lab the list of vulnerabilties and the scores assigned to the images may differ from those provided by the image scanning tools available in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kuberenetes. Beginning with updated versions to be released in Spring of 2024 these values will begin to coalesce. It's entirely possible this will be the case by the time you participate in this lab, if you attempt to replicate outside of this lab environment.

== Conclusion

We hope you have enjoyed this lab using Red Hat Quay to create and host your own repository, upload and use an image, and examine the image for security vulnerabilites.
