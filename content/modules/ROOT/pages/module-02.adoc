= Store, Scan and Deploy Applications with Red Hat Quay

In this module we will be acting as the devloper.(UPDATE STORY)

[[build-app]]

[[quay-login]]

==== Login to Quay from the CLI

*Procedure*

[start=1]
. Run the following command.

====
Let's export a few variables to make things easier. These variables will stay in the .bashrc file so they're saved in case you need to refresh the terminal.
====

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
echo export QUAY_USER={quay_admin_username} >> ~/.bashrc
QUAY_USER={quay_admin_username}
----

[start=2]

. Run the following command to set the Quay URL variable 

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
echo export QUAY_URL=$(oc -n quay get route quay-quay -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}') >> ~/.bashrc
QUAY_URL=$(oc -n quay get route quay-quay -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
----

IMPORTANT: Verify that the variables are correct

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
echo $QUAY_USER
echo $QUAY_URL
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ echo $QUAY_USER
echo $QUAY_URL
quayadmin
quay-bq65l.apps.cluster-bq65l.bq65l.sandbox209.opentlc.com
----

[start=3]
. Using the terminal on the bastion host, login to quay using the Podman CLI as shown below:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
podman login $QUAY_URL
----

NOTE: Use the quay admin credentials to sign in. 

[cols="2,2"]
|===
*Quay Username:* | *{quay_admin_username}* |
*Quay Password:* | *{quay_admin_password}* |
|===

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
Username: quayadmin
Password:
Login Succeeded!
----

Beautiful! We're logged in. Now you can download build and push images directly to your quay repository.

[[golden-image]]

=== Create our developer golden image

Imagine a base image as a blank canvas, providing a reliable foundation like a minimal operating system or runtime environment. Developers add the essential configurations, libraries, and tools needed to fit their application's unique demands. By tagging this customized creation as a golden image, developers ensure every deployment uses the same standardized, consistent setup, simplifying workflows and avoiding unexpected surprises.

*Procedure*

. Run the following commands 

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
podman pull python:3.12-alpine
----

[[dev-app]]

=== Create the applications frontend, and upload it to Quay

In this section, we will add the application code to the image, build, tag and push the new image to Quay. Later, we'll use that image to deploy and application to the OpenShift Cluster.

TIP: With the variables saved in the ~/.bashrc file you will not have to declare them again in the future.

NOTE: Quay will automatically create a private registry to store our TBD application since we have admin access. To deploy the app, you'll need to make the repository public so you can pull the image without credentials.

[[quay]]

== Access Quay 

Your Red Hat Quay console is available at: {quay_console_url}[window=blank]

Administrator login is available with:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]

[cols="1,1"]
|===
*Quay Console Username:* | {quay_admin_username} |
*Quay Console Password:* | {quay_admin_password} |
|===

[[navigating-the-registry]]

== Browse the registry

In the setup module we downloaded built and pushed a insecure java application called *frontend*. Now it's time to deploy it to the OpenShift Cluster. To do this we will need to make the registry that we created public. 

Let's take a look at our application in the registry.

image::02-quay-login.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Next, click on the *frontend* repository. 

The information tab shows you information such as;

- Podman and Docker commands
- Repository activity
- The repository description. 

image::02-frontend-repo.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

====
On the left hand side of the window you should see the following icons labelled in order from top to bottom,
====

image::02-quay-sidebar.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

- Information
- Tags
- Tag History
- Usage Logs
- Settings


[start=2]
. Click on the *Tags* icon. 

image::02-quay-tags.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

This tab displays all of the images and tags that have been upladed, providing information such as fixable vulnerabilities, the image size and allows for bulk changes to images based on the security posture. 

We will explore this tab a little later in this module.

[start=3]
. Click on the *Tags History* icon. 

image::02-quay-history.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

This tab simply displays the container images history over time. 

[start=4]
. Click into the SHA256 hash number. 

image::02-image-details.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

From this dashboard you will be able to see the image manifest of that container image.

image::02-image-manifest.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=5]
. Click the *BACK* icon in the top left of the dashboard then click on the *Usage Logs* icon. 

image::02-quay-back.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
image::02-quay-usage.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]


This tab displays the usage over time along with details about who/how the images were pushed to the cluster. 

====
You should see that you (The "quayadmin") pushed an image tagged 0.1 to the repository today. 
====

[start=6]
. Lastly click on the *Settings* icon. 

image::02-quay-settings.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

In this tab you can add/remove users and update permissions, alter the privacy of the repository, and even schedule alerts based on found vulnerabilities.

[start=6]
. Make your repository public before deploying our application in the next step by clicking the *Make Public* button under *Repository Visibility*

image::02-quay-public.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

IMPORTANT: Make sure to make the repository public. Otherwise we will not be able to deploy the application in the ACM section.

[start=7]
. Click OK

[[vulnerability-scanning-with-quay]]

== Vulnerability Scanning with Quay

Red Hat Quay can also help with securing our environments by performing a container vulnerability scan on any images added to our registry, and advise which ones are potentially fixable. This feature is also known as vulnerability scanning at rest.

Use the following procedure to check the security scan results for our Java container image you have uploaded.

*Procedure*

. Click on the *Tags* icon on the left side of the screen like before.

image::02-quay-tags.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: You may need to click the checkbox near the image you would would like more information on, but the column for *Security Scan* should populate.

[start=2]
. By default, the security scan color codes the vulnerabilities, you can hover over the security scan for more information.

image::02-quay-scan-hover.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: The alpine container image we are using in this lab shows 34 vulnerabilities, with 2 cirtical vulnerabilities. This number will change with time and will be different between container scanners for a variety of reasons such as reporting mechanisms, vulnerability feeds and operating system support. 

[start=3]
. Click on the list of vulnerabilities to see a more detailed view.

image::02-quay-security.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%] 
image::02-quay-vuln-overview.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]


[start=4]
. Click on a vulnerable package on the left menu to get more information about the vulnerability and see what you have to do to fix the issue.

image::02-quay-vuln-detailed.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: Toggling for fixable/unfixable vulnerabilities is an excellent way for developers to understand what is within their responsibility for fixing. For example, since we are using an older version of Java, many fixes are available for these common issues. 

Congratulations, you now know how to examine images in your registry for potential vulnerabilities before deploying into your environment.

==== (TESTING ONLY - REMOVE BEFORE LAUNCH) Deploy the application


IMPORTANT: Please ensure the deploy application are deployed to your cluster before moving onto the next module. 

Perfect! 

Test it out by running the following:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
sed -i "s|image: .*|image: ${QUAY_URL}/${QUAY_USER}/frontend:0.1|" $TUTORIAL_HOME/skupper-demo/frontend.yml
oc apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/skupper-demo/ --recursive
oc get routes | grep frontend-patient-route | awk '{print "http://" $2}'
----

Ensure access to application. Watch out for browser certificates.  

Add Quay repo as an integration
